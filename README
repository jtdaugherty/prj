To get started, include the prj tool in your own shell script:

  . /path/to/prj/src/prj.sh

To initialize and register project:

  mkdir myproject
  cd myproject
  prj-init

This will generate a "prj" directory in myproject/:

  prj/main.sh
  prj/hosts/<your hostname>.sh
  prj/autoload.d/

Any scripts in autoload.d will be loaded on any host.  A hostname-specific
script will be loaded from hosts/.  The main script will also always be
loaded.

The prj tool exposes some functions for your use in these scripts; at
present, the most useful one is add_PATH:

  add_PATH /some/directory

This will always add the specified directory to your PATH unless it is
already in the PATH.

To show registered projects:

  prj-list

To reload an active project:

  prj-reload

To change directories to an active project's home:

  cdprj
